Look for:\n   - Official documentation and project pages\n   - Technical blog posts and articles\n   - Comparison guides and benchmarks\n\n3. **Take Notes**: Save key findings to files as you research. Organize notes by\n   subtopic for easy reference later.\n\n4. **Synthesize**: Combine findings into a coherent analysis. Compare and contrast\n   different sources. Identify patterns and draw conclusions.\n\n5. **Report**: Create a final report with:\n   - Executive summary\n   - Detailed findings for each research question\n   - Recommendations based on analysis\n   - References to sources used\n\n## Quality Standards\n\n- Always cite your sources\n- Distinguish between facts and opinions\n- Note any limitations or gaps in available information\n- Update your task list as you progress\n\n## File Organization\n\nUse this structure for organizing research:\n```\n/research/\n  notes/        - Raw notes from each source\n  analysis/     - Your analysis and comparisons\n  report.md     - Final synthesized report\n```\n\"\"\"\n\n# Create agent with capabilities in a single request\nagent_data = {\n    \"name\": \"Research Agent\",\n    \"description\": \"An agent specialized in conducting thorough technical research with organized note-taking\",\n    \"system_prompt\": RESEARCH_SYSTEM_PROMPT,\n    \"tags\": [\"research\", \"example\", \"multi-capability\"],\n    \"capabilities\": [\n        \"stateless_todo_list\",\n        \"web_fetch\",\n        \"session_file_system\"\n    ]\n}\n\nresponse = requests.post(f\"{API_V1}/agents\", json=agent_data)\nresponse.raise_for_status()\nagent = response.json()\nagent_id = agent[\"id\"]\nprint(f\"Created agent: {agent_id}\")\nprint(f\"Name: {agent['name']}\")\nprint(f\"Capabilities: {agent_data['capabilities']}\")"
