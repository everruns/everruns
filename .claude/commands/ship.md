# Ship

Run the full ship flow: verify quality, ensure test coverage, update artifacts, smoke test, then push, create PR, and merge when CI is green.

This command implements the complete "Shipping" definition and Pre-PR Checklist from AGENTS.md. When the user says "ship" or "fix and ship", execute ALL phases below — not just the push/merge steps.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` - Optional: description of what is being shipped (used for PR title/body context and to scope the quality checks)

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Pre-flight

1. Confirm we're NOT on `main` or `master`
2. Confirm there are no uncommitted changes (`git diff --quiet && git diff --cached --quiet`)
3. If uncommitted changes exist, stop and tell the user

### Phase 2: Test Coverage

Review the changes on this branch (use `git diff origin/main...HEAD` and `git log origin/main..HEAD`) and ensure comprehensive test coverage:

1. **Identify all changed code paths** — every new/modified function, endpoint, handler, component
2. **Verify existing tests cover the changes** — run `cargo test --all-features` and check for failures
3. **Write missing tests** for any uncovered code paths:
   - **Positive tests**: happy path, valid inputs, expected state transitions
   - **Negative tests**: invalid inputs, error conditions, boundary cases, permission failures, missing resources
   - **Backend tests**: unit tests for logic, integration tests for API endpoints and database operations
   - **UI tests**: if UI code was changed, verify `npm run lint` and `npm run build` pass in `apps/ui/`; add/update component tests as needed
4. **Run all tests** to confirm green: `cargo test --all-features`
5. If any test fails, fix the code or test until green

### Phase 3: Artifact Updates

Review the changes and update project artifacts where applicable. Skip items that aren't affected.

1. **Specs** (`specs/`): if the change adds/modifies behavior covered by a spec, update the relevant spec file to stay in sync
2. **Threat model** (`specs/threat-model.md`): if the change introduces new attack surfaces, external inputs, authentication/authorization changes, or data handling — add or update threat entries using the `TM-<CATEGORY>-<NNN>` format and add `// THREAT[TM-XXX-NNN]` code comments at mitigation points
3. **AGENTS.md**: if the change adds new specs, skills, or modifies development workflows — update the relevant section
4. **Test cases** (`test_cases/`): for significant new features or complex flows, add manual test cases following the `TC###_short_description.md` format in `specs/test-cases.md`
5. **Documentation** (`apps/docs/`): if the change affects user-facing APIs, configuration, or features documented on the docs site — update the relevant docs pages
6. **OpenAPI spec**: if API endpoints were added/modified, run `./scripts/export-openapi.sh` to regenerate

### Phase 4: Smoke Testing

Smoke test impacted functionality to verify it works end-to-end:

1. **UI changes**: start dev server (`just start-dev --no-watch`), verify the UI loads and changed functionality works. Take UI screenshots if applicable using the `ui-screenshots` skill.
2. **Backend/API changes**: start full mode (`sudo -E .claude/skills/no-docker-setup/scripts/start.sh` or `just start-all --no-watch`), hit affected endpoints, verify responses.
3. **Database/migration changes**: test in full mode with PostgreSQL to verify migrations apply and queries work.
4. Stop any servers started for smoke testing before proceeding.

If smoke testing reveals issues, fix them and loop back to Phase 2 (tests must still pass).

### Phase 5: Quality Gates

```bash
git fetch origin main && git rebase origin/main
```

- If rebase fails with conflicts, abort and tell the user to resolve manually

```bash
just pre-push
```

- If it fails, run `just fmt` to auto-fix, then retry once
- If still failing, stop and report

```bash
just pre-pr
```

- If it fails, stop and report the failures

### Phase 6: Push and PR

```bash
git push -u origin <current-branch>
```

Check for existing PR:

```bash
gh pr view --json url 2>/dev/null
```

If no PR exists, create one using the PR template (`.github/pull_request_template.md`):

- **Title**: conventional commit style from the branch commits
- **Body**: fill in the PR template sections (What, Why, How, Risk, Checklist) based on the actual changes. Include what tests were added/verified.
- Use `gh pr create`

If a PR already exists, update it if needed and report its URL.

### Phase 7: Wait for CI and Merge

- Check CI status with `gh pr checks` (poll every 30s, up to 15 minutes)
- If CI is green, merge with `gh pr merge --squash --auto`
- If CI fails, report the failing checks and stop
- **NEVER** merge when CI is red

### Phase 8: Post-merge

After successful merge:

- Report the merged PR URL
- Done

## Notes

- This is the canonical shipping workflow. It implements the full "Shipping" definition and Pre-PR Checklist from AGENTS.md.
- Phases 2-4 (tests, artifacts, smoke testing) are the quality core — do NOT skip them.
- The `$ARGUMENTS` context helps scope which tests, specs, and smoke tests are relevant.
- For "fix and ship" requests: implement the fix first, then run `/ship` to validate and merge.
