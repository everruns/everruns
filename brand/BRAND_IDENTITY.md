# Everruns Brand Identity

## Brand Essence

### Name: Everruns
The name captures the core promise: AI agents that **ever run** — continuous, uninterrupted, eternal execution. No matter what happens (crashes, restarts, failures), your agents keep running.

### Tagline Options
- "AI Agents that never stop"
- "Durable AI. Unstoppable agents."
- "Run forever. Resume instantly."
- "Where AI agents become immortal"

### Brand Positioning
Everruns is the **durability layer** for AI agents. While others focus on making agents smarter, we focus on making them **unkillable**. Enterprise-grade persistence meets developer simplicity.

## Color Palette

### Primary Palette (App Interface)
Almost black and white — timeless, minimal, lets the work shine.

| Name | Hex | Usage |
|------|-----|-------|
| **Obsidian** | `#0A0A0A` | Primary text, headers, key UI |
| **Charcoal** | `#1A1A1A` | Secondary backgrounds, cards |
| **Slate** | `#404040` | Secondary text, borders |
| **Silver** | `#A0A0A0` | Muted text, placeholders |
| **Smoke** | `#F5F5F5` | Light backgrounds |
| **White** | `#FFFFFF` | Primary background, cards |

### Accent Palette (Brand Identity & Logo)
Inspired by Ukrainian colors — representing resilience, independence, and hope.

| Name | Hex | Inspiration |
|------|-----|-------------|
| **Azure** | `#0057B8` | Ukrainian blue — sky, infinity, trust |
| **Gold** | `#FFD700` | Ukrainian yellow — wheat, prosperity, energy |
| **Sunrise** | `#FFA500` | Warm accent — warmth between blue and gold |

### Usage Guidelines
- **App UI**: 95% grayscale, 5% accent for critical actions
- **Logo**: Can use full accent colors
- **Marketing**: More freedom with accent palette
- **Success states**: Gold accent
- **Links/Actions**: Azure accent

## Typography

### Primary Font: Geist Sans
Already in use — clean, modern, technical. Keep it.

### Hierarchy
```
H1: Geist Sans, 600 weight, 2.5rem
H2: Geist Sans, 600 weight, 2rem
H3: Geist Sans, 500 weight, 1.5rem
Body: Geist Sans, 400 weight, 1rem
Code: Geist Mono, 400 weight, 0.875rem
```

### Logo Typography
Consider **custom lettering** for "Everruns" that incorporates:
- Continuous flow (no breaks in letterforms)
- Subtle connection between letters suggesting persistence
- The "∞" infinity symbol hidden in the word

## Logo Concept: Three Intersecting Circles

### Symbolism
The three circles represent the **core pillars** of Everruns:

```
       Durability
          ○
         / \
        /   \
       /     \
      ○-------○
 Scalability  Reliability
```

The **intersection** (center) represents Everruns — where all three qualities meet.

### Alternative Interpretations
1. **Agent → Thread → Run**: The execution lifecycle
2. **Past → Present → Future**: Continuity across time
3. **Code → State → Recovery**: The persistence mechanism
4. **API → Worker → UI**: The system architecture

### Visual Treatments

#### Option A: Venn Diagram (Minimal)
Three overlapping circles in grayscale with the intersection highlighted in gold or azure.

```
    ◯
   ◯ ◯
```

#### Option B: Olympic Style (Dynamic)
Three interlocking circles (like chain links) suggesting unbreakable connection.

#### Option C: Atom/Orbit (Technical)
Three circles arranged as electron orbits around a central point — suggesting constant motion.

#### Option D: Infinity Loop (Conceptual)
Three circles forming a continuous path — no beginning, no end.

## Icon System

### App Icon
The three-circle logo works at all sizes:
- **Favicon (16x16)**: Simplified to three overlapping dots
- **App Icon (512x512)**: Full detail with gradients
- **Touch Icon**: Medium detail, strong contrast

### UI Icons
Continue using **Lucide React** for consistency. Key icons:
- **Bot** → Agents
- **Play** → Runs
- **MessageSquare** → Chat/Threads
- **Activity** → Status/Monitoring
- **Shield** → Durability/Reliability

## Visual Language

### Design Principles

1. **Clarity over decoration**
   - Every element serves a purpose
   - White space is a feature, not waste

2. **Consistency builds trust**
   - Same patterns, same interactions
   - Predictable = reliable (our core value)

3. **Subtle sophistication**
   - Refined details for those who notice
   - Never flashy, always polished

4. **Dark mode is first-class**
   - Not an afterthought
   - Both modes equally beautiful

### UI Patterns

**Cards**: Sharp corners (0-4px radius), subtle borders
**Buttons**: Solid fills, no gradients, clear hierarchy
**States**:
- Default: Grayscale
- Hover: Slight lightening/darkening
- Active: Azure accent
- Success: Gold accent
- Error: Muted red
