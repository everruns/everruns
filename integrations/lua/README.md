# everruns-integrations-lua

> Deprecated compatibility package for the Lua integration.

[Everruns](https://everruns.com) is an agentic runtime and control plane.

This crate is a one-release compatibility shim. Migrate to [`everruns-integrations`](https://crates.io/crates/everruns-integrations) with the `lua` feature. This package will be removed in the following platform release.

## Quick Start

```rust
use everruns-integrations::lua as _;
```

## Features

The `lua` feature forwards to the maintained module in `everruns-integrations`. New applications should depend directly on that crate; compatibility imports continue to resolve during this release.
